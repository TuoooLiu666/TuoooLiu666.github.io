<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello! Iâ€™m **LT** (Tuo Liu), Ph.D., an environmental health scientist with expertise in omics technologies, statistical analysis, and occupational health research. I recently earned my Ph.D. in Environmental Health Sciences, with a minor in Biostatistics, from the University of Arizona.

My research bridges environmental/occupational exposure, statistical analsis, and public health practice. I focus on applying metabolomics and proteomics to better understand how environmental and occupational exposures impact vulnerable populations, particularly frontline and essential workers such as firefighters and healthcare professionals.

Currently, I am a Postdoc-research associate at the department of Population and Public Health Science at USC where I evaluate the metabolic profiles by bone mineral density across life span in Latino populations. 

For the past 4 years, I worked as a Research Associate in the Burgess Lab and the Furlong Lab, where I develop and implement statistical pipelines for biomarker discovery, metabolic & proteomic profiling, and health risk evaluation for the Firefighter Cancer Cohort Study (FFCCS) and the Arizona Healthcare, Emergency Response, and Other Essential Workers Surveillance (AZ HEROES) Study.

My research portfolio includes:

- Omics Applications: Conducting untargeted and targeted metabolomics and proteomics analyses to uncover biological mechanisms linked to environmental exposures & health conditions.
- Statistical Expertise: Designing and applying standard statistical method, multilevel modeling/longitudinal data analysis, and machine learning methods to large-scale epidemiological and Omics datasets.
- Public Health Impact: Generating actionable insights into occupational risks and advancing strategies to protect high-risk populations.

Beyond research, I am passionate about translating complex scientific findings into accessible knowledge that informs public health policies and interventions. I also create interactive tools and visualizations to help bridge the gap between data science and community health practice.

In all my work, I am driven by the goal of advancing health equity, improving occupational health, and innovating at the intersection of environmental exposures, data science, and public health.
