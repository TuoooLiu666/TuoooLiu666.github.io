<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello! I’m **LT** (Tuo Liu), Ph.D., an environmental health scientist with expertise in omics technologies, statistical analysis, and occupational health research. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Environmental Health Sciences with a minor in Biostatistics at the University of Arizona.

My work bridges environmental and occupational exposures, advanced data analysis, and public health interventions, with a focus on applying metabolomics and proteomics to understand how exposures affect vulnerable populations, particularly firefighters and healthcare professionals.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Population and Public Health Sciences at USC, where I study metabolic profiles in relation to bone mineral density across the lifespan in Latino populations. Previously, I worked as a Research Associate in the Burgess and Furlong Labs, developing statistical pipelines for biomarker discovery, omics profiling, and health risk evaluation in projects such as the Firefighter Cancer Cohort Study (FFCCS) and the Arizona HEROES Study (AZHEROES).

My research portfolio includes:

- Omics Applications: Untargeted and targeted metabolomics/proteomics analyses to uncover biological mechanisms of exposure-related health effects.
- Statistical Expertise: Application of standard, multilevel/longitudinal, and machine learning methods to complex epidemiological and omics datasets.
- Public Health Impact: Translating findings into actionable insights that inform strategies to protect high-risk populations.

Beyond research, I am passionate about making science accessible—developing interactive tools, visualizations, and knowledge translation approaches that connect data-driven discoveries to public health policy and practice. Across all my work, I am guided by the commitment to raising public awareness, improve occupational health, and innovate at the intersection of environmental exposures, data science, and public health.
