She uses a variety of methodological approaches to achieve these goals, including the use of -OMICs technologies (particularly metabolomics and epigenomics), as well as developing and linking large exposure databases with state-wide health outcomes databases, including Medicaid. She also uses metabolomic and epigenetic approaches to study long-term, subclinical health effects of occupational and environmental exposures in firefighters."

Much of his recent research has involved firefighters, a group known to have increased cancer rates compared to the general population. Working in partnership with the Tucson Fire Department, his research team has identified effective interventions to reduce fireground exposures. In addition, the team has identified circulating microRNA and DNA methylation markers of increased cancer risk among firefighters. Dr. Burgess also is leading a research team that established and is now expanding the Fire Fighter Cancer Cohort Study (FFCCS), a national multicenter prospective study including exposure measurement, biomarkers of effect and cancer outcomes."
