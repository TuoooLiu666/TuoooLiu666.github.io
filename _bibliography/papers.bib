Hispanic and black firefighters are at increased risk of additional cancers not elevated in non-Hispanic white firefighters, yet biological pathways underlying these differences are unknown. Objectives The study objectives were to evaluate differences in the urinary metabolome between Hispanic and non-Hispanic firefighters, pre-and post-fireground exposure. Methods To investigate the metabolic patterns, we employed a comprehensive metabolomics pipeline that leveraged liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. We applied linear mixed effects regression to identify the differential metabolites at an FDR < 0.05 among 19 Hispanic and 81 non-Hispanic firefighters. We also performed overrepresentation analysis using Mummichog to identify enriched pathways at FDR < 0.05. Results Out of 175 features in HILIC(−) mode and 1847 features in RP(+) mode, we found 26 and 276 differential urinary features, respectively, when comparing Hispanic and non-Hispanic firefighters. We noted pathway enrichment in tryptophan and galactose metabolism. However, post-exposure, we did not observe differences in the metabolomic response by ethnicity despite differing fireground exposures. Conclusion Dysregulation in the tryptophan and galactose pathway is an important contributor to cancer risks and may explain the increased cancer risk among Hispanic firefighters.

Untargeted metabolomics was applied to characterize this suite of environmental exposures and biological changes in response to occupational firefighting. 200 urine samples from 100 firefighters collected at baseline and two to four hours post-fire were analyzed using untargeted liquid-chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Changes in metabolite abundance after a fire were estimated with fixed effects linear regression, with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was also used, and variable important projection (VIP) scores were extracted. Systemic changes were evaluated using pathway enrichment for highly discriminating metabolites. Metabolome-wide-association-study (MWAS) identified 268 metabolites associated with firefighting activity at FDR q < 0.05. Of these, 20 were annotated with high confidence, including the amino acids taurine, proline, and betaine; the indoles kynurenic acid and indole-3-acetic acid; the known uremic toxins trimethylamine n-oxide and hippuric acid; and the hormone 7a-hydroxytestosterone. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) additionally implicated choline, cortisol, and other hormones. Significant pathways included metabolism of urea cycle/amino group, alanine and aspartate, aspartate and asparagine, vitamin b3 (nicotinate and nicotinamide), and arginine and proline. Firefighters show a broad metabolic response to fires, including altered excretion of indole compounds and uremic toxins. Implicated pathways and features, particularly uremic toxins, may be important regulators of firefighter’s increased risk for urinary tract cancers.}}


@ARTICLE{Liu_2025_2,selected={false},abbr={EnvHealth},title={Evaluating Urine Metabolic Profiles with Wildland- Urban-Interface (WUI) Fire Exposure: A Comparison with Municipal Structure Fires (MSF)},year={2025},author={Tuo Liu and Melissa A. Furlong and Shawn C. Beitel and J. Gulotta and J. Galligan and Douglas I. Walker and J. Goodrich and J. Burgess},doi={null},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={null},journal={Metabolomics},abstract={Firefighters have frequent exposure to carcinogens and an increased risk of cancer. Wildland-urban interface (WUI) fires, which involve both structures and undeveloped wildland fuels, pose unique challenges to the health of firefighters. However, the extent of health risks associated with these fires remains underexplored. This study aims to identify altered urine metabolites and metabolic processes among male firefighters that were associated with WUI fires as compared with municipal structure fires (MSF). Untargeted metabolomic profiling was applied to pre-exposure (baseline) and postfire urine samples collected from firefighters responding to WUI and MSF exposure. Differential analysis was conducted by fitting linear mixed effects regression models on preprocessed ion intensity and exposure status while adjusting for demographic covariates. Differential metabolites by post-exposure status were identified using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of <0.05. Enrichment analysis was performed to identify pathways that were significantly perturbed at a Bonferroni adjusted p-value <0.05 level. Eighty-five firefighters contributed paired baseline and post-fire samples from WUI events, and 98 firefighters contributed paired baseline and post-fire samples from MSF events. We performed metabolic profiling on baseline and postfire urine samples from WUI and structure fires using four modes: HILIC(-), HILIC(+), C18(-), and C18(+) and identified metabolites against an in-house library. We identified 244, 297, 320, and 266 level 1 metabolites from the four respective modes. In the statistical analysis, the main model identified a total of 176 differential metabolites from WUI fires. For MSF, the model identified a total of 652 differential metabolites from the four respective modes. Most metabolites with significant changes after a WUI fire also changed significantly after an MSF event. Two pathways were significantly enriched after WUI fires, while seven pathways were significantly enriched after MSF exposure and two pathways overlapped between the two types of fires. Fire exposure induces numerous metabolic perturbations in firefighters that may partially explain their elevated cancer risks. Although individual metabolites changed in a similar fashion across both WUI and MSF, structure fires were associated with an increased number of metabolite changes and some of the altered pathways differed between exposures to WUI fires vs. MSF. These results suggest that exposures to WUI fires and MSF present both common and unique cancer risks for firefighters.}}

Galligan and Douglas I. Walker and J. Burgess},doi={null},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={null},journal={Environmental Research},abstract={The occupation of firefighting is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen. Increased cancer risk among firefighters may be partly attributable to increased occupational exposure to a range of chemicals, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Some PFAS are known and suspect human carcinogens. Investigating epigenetic response to these PFAS exposures in firefighters may help to identify biological pathways of specific cancers, and previously unidentified health outcomes that are associated with PFAS. We therefore investigated the associations of serum PFAS concentrations with miRNA expression in firefighters. Sera collected from 303 firefighters from 6 sites across the USA were analyzed for 9 PFAS along with miRNA expression. Linear regression was used to estimate associations between log PFAS and miRNA expression, with false discovery rate (FDR) set to 0.05 for significance, and an exploratory cutoff of FDR q<0.20. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using miRTarBase’s miRWalk pathways. Age, race-ethnicity, BMI, fire department, and sex were controlled for in all models. At FDR<0.05, the linear isomer of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was inversely associated with hsa-miR-128-15p expression (Beta = -0.146, 95% CI -0.216, -0.076). At a relaxed FDR of 0.20, we observed inverse associations for the sum of branched isomers of PFOS with 5 miRNAs (hsa-let-7d-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-miR-423-5p, hsa-let-7b-5p, has-mir-629-5p). Several pathways were enriched for multiple PFAS, including those correlated with certain cancers, blood diseases, thyroid disorders, autoimmune disorders, and neurological outcomes. Some PFAS in firefighters were found to be associated with alteration of miRNA consistent with increased risk for a range of chronic diseases.}}
