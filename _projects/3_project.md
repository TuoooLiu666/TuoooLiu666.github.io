- **Prostates cancer**, **Metabolomics**: Evaluating Differential Metabolic Profile by Prostate Cancer Grade among Prostate Cancer Patients
  - Conducted metabolomics analysis on 22 urine samples from prostate cancer patients who were disgnozed with prostate cancer
  - Developed and validated statistical models to compare metabolic profiles across high vs. low PCa risk group
  - Lead author for a manuscript (submitted to Metabolites) {% cite Liu_2025_7 %}

- **Bone Health**, **Metabolomics**: TBD
  - Multi-cohort spanning from adolescence, young adulthood, to senior adulthood
  - Analyzed 304/250 plasma samples for metabolic signals in association with bone mineral densities 
  - Integrated metabolomics datasets for comparative analysis
  - Lead author for a manuscript (under development)
